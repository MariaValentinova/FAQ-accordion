## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to control behavior in different uses: keyboard or mouse with the help of ChatGPT. 
This project helped me reinforce my understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design principles. 

```Some Css code I'm proud of
/* Agregar outline solo cuando se usa el teclado */
.accordion-item.keyboard-focus {
    outline: 2px solid var(--Light-pink);
}

/* Eliminar el outline cuando se usa el rat√≥n */
.using-mouse .accordion-item.keyboard-focus {
    outline: none;
}


### Continued development

I would like to improve my understanding of JavaScript functionalities.
